        Please excuse the user experience quirks - this is an experimental decentralized exchange that is still under heavy development. To get started, go to <strong>deposit/withdraw</strong> and deposit ETH to turn it into W-ETH (Ethereum Token Standard). After depositing ETH, go to <strong>Trade</strong> and set your allowance (999999 works). When ready you can place new orders or trade existing orders. <strong>Click on an open order on the order book to buy/sell into it</strong>.
